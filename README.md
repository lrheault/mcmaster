## Automated Textual Analysis of Parliamentary Debates

This workshop provides an overview of methods for automated textual analysis applied to parliamentary debates.  We will look at concrete examples based on the Lipad database (www.lipad.ca), an open resource giving assess to digitized parliamentary debates from the Canadian House of Commons for the past 115 years.  The workshop will illustrate how to read the textual content of parliamentary corpora using the Python programming language, how to transform the data into a term-document matrix, and how to fit basic models for textual analysis, with an emphasis on topic modeling.  

Participants who wish to reproduce the exercises interactively on their laptops during the workshop are invited to install Python.  The required software is free to use, and available for all operating systems.
